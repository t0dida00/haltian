# INDOOR AIR QUALITY MONITORING

The project aimed to create an indoor air quality monitoring application using Thingsee Air and Environment sensors. The app would display carbon dioxide, humidity, temperature, light level, air pressure, and sunrise/sunset times, and alert the user if any readings were concerning. The app also included a history feature for administrators to view past data. The app was designed to be dynamic, allowing users to input host URL, port, and topic and select the protocol and necessary certificates.


## Technologies

Server-side: NodeJs (v16.14.x) â€“ ExpressJS(v4.18.x). 

Client-side: ReactJS. 

Protocol: mqtt, socketIO. 

Equipments: the Thingsee Air, Enviroment and Gateway sensors. 

Database: MongoDB. 

## Tools:
Coding: Visual code.

UX/UI draft: Figma

Project management: Trello

API testing: Postman

Hosting: Microsoft Azure + Docker

References: Google + ChatGPT

Backend : https://air-quality.azurewebsites.net/


Frontend :https://main--lustrous-platypus-be1445.netlify.app/?fbclid=IwAR2N_vHAJqSPX_s2CT2HDm9qV_BIK6CQ5HPsjPOqm46fJxKRLDKvtBvkXYQ

## Main Features
+ Dashboard: A dashboard that provides an overview of the current environmental conditions in the location, including CO2 levels, air pressure, humidity, temperature, light level and TVOC levels. This dashboard could display the data in a clear and visually appealing way, such as with graphs, charts, and other data visualizations. Besides, it provides the outdoor weather which is getting from the weather API
+ Alerts: The web application could include alerts that notify users when environmental conditions exceed certain thresholds. For example, if the CO2 level reaches a certain threshold, the web application could send an email or push notification to the user to alert them to the issue.
+ Historical data: The web application could include a historical data feature that allows users to view past environmental conditions for a specific location. This feature could include graphs or other data visualizations that show trends over time for each environmental parameter.

## Application Architecture

1.	A user needs to input the mqtt client information to connect to the Thingsee mqtt Broker.
2.	The application will connect to the Gateway sensor through mqtt protocol to get data from sensors.
3.	When the data comes, it will be handled by a handler such as formatting the da-ta, checking the threshold.
4.	After the data is analyzed, it will be saved to MongoDB and displayed to UI.
a.	MongoDB Cloud: the data will be saved every 30 minutes
b.	Display: the data will be shown on UI every 5 minutes after the data comes and is formatted.
5.	A user can check history of Temperature, Humidity and Carbon dioxide in the history pages, the data comes from MongoDB

## Notes

The application is using MQTT protocol and connects with the Thingsee Air and Thingsee Environment sensors only. 

Only one topic is subscribed in one period. 

When a topic is subscribed already,it can not subscribe more topic. 

The Indoor Air Quality score is only calculated when humidity, tvoc, temperature, carbon dioxide are collected

The Indoor Air Quality is only relative, not absolute

The thresholds and alerts are referenced from online sources and ChatGPT 

The elements display on the screen when the sensors return the data every 5 minutes (development)/ 30 minutes(production) 

The data is saved on MongoDB every 5 minutes (development)/ 30 minutes(production) 

Validations are not applied in this project. All inputs should be valid.
